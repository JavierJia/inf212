Hi Professor, 

I'm using "ruby bundle" to write gem packages.
There are two "word_extractor" lib and two "frequencies" lib in the folder.

Then I'm using the 'Gemfile' to install all the packages by run 
> bundle install

The `config.rb` is the configuration to sepecify which lib we gonna use. 
The actual run file `19_1.rb` will include the conresponding lib specified in 
`config.rb`.

To be able to run the program, I need to call bundle again to load the package 
and then run the program

> bundle exec ruby 19_1.rb ../pride-and-prejudice.txt

The simple way is to call the ./run.sh <the_file_path>
e.g.
> ./run.sh ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
